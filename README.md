A very weak auto-clicker for G123's Space Battleship Yamato: Voyagers of Tomorrow

G123 produces a variety of browser based games, including one based on Space Battleship Yamato. Unfortunately, not only is the game relatively boring, it also requires quite a bit more effort than it should. Although an auto-clicker function is built into the game already, this project is meant to provide a free alternative for at least some of the more time-intensive activities.
